--- Opacity Controller ---
commissioned by Queen Snek
developed by GabeHasWon

A simple client-side mod that allows you to control the opacity of all projectiles.
A lot of mods enjoy spamming as many projectiles on screen as possible, so using this allows you to reduce noise on screen.
Supports modifying your own projectiles, other player's projectiles, and enemy projectiles.

Do note: Not all projectiles will be modified perfectly, but this will get most projectiles.
Some projectiles, especially fancier modded ones, will ignore this entirely. There's not much to be done about it.
